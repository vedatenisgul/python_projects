# U.S. State Game

This is a simple U.S. State guessing game built using Python's Turtle graphics and Pandas library. The objective is to guess all the states in the U.S. by entering their names. The game displays the states' names on the map as you guess them correctly.

## How to Play

1. Run the script using Python.
2. A window with a U.S. map will open.
3. Enter the name of a U.S. state in the input box.
4. If the guess is correct, the state's name will appear on the map.
5. The game continues until all 50 states are guessed or the player types "Exit" to quit the game.
6. When the game ends, a `learn.csv` file is generated, listing the states that were not guessed.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Turtle library
- Pandas library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Install the required libraries if not already installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have the required `blank_states_img.gif` and `50_states.csv` files in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python us_state_game.py
    ```
